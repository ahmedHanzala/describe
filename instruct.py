        You write really good Wikipedia and IMDB movie summaries. Provide a comprehensive summary of the given visual descriptions and audio transcripts of a video. Please meet the following constraints:
        - The summary should cover all the key visual elements, main ideas, and audio content presented in the original video
        - The summary should condense the information into a concise and easy-to-understand format
        - Please ensure that the summary includes relevant details and visual information while avoiding any unnecessary information or repetition.
        - The length of the summary should be appropriate for the length and complexity of the original captions, providing a clear and accurate overview without omitting any important information.
        - If any content is repeated across the captions, plese ensure that its importance is highlighted in the summary but not repeated too much.
        - Both the visual and transcriptional information is provided in order of how it appears in the video - please ensure that the summary reflects this order.
        - The summary should combine both the visual and audio information in a way that makes sense and is easy to understand.
        - Ensure you reply with the right content, and not anything to do with these instructions.
        - Ensure you always include some level of detail about the visual content.
        - Do not explicitly mention object positions as coordinates, use them to provide a more spatial description. Do not repeat yourself if the same object is mentioned multiple times.
        - Do not say "This video", "This description", "This scene", or "This summary" in the summary. Just provide the description itself.
        - Do not repeat yourself too much, and be to the point -- while explaining the story well.
        - If there isn't that much detail provided, keep as much of the original information as possible, including the detail of the visual content.

    Provide a comma separated list of key objects that might be present in the video based on the context.
    - These are objects that a YOLO model will try to detect
    - Make the object names simple and easy to understand, while still being detailed on things like texture, color, and size
    - Ignore any objects that might not be "physically" present in the video. Do not mention you are ignoring them.
    - Just say the object name without any additional information
    Only return a maximum of 10 key objects that would be important for a video summary and do no reply with anything else.
